            There are many who would take my time. I
            shun them.
            There are some who share my time. I am
            entertained by them.
            There are precious few who contribute to my
            time. I cherish them.

            The hunter must hunt. The moment he stops
            he becomes the hunted.

            Be wary of advise from one who is less
            successful than yourself.

            Self-improvement books: those who need
            them won't read them or heed them. Don't help
            someone who has proven themselves a
            consistent failure in the past.

            Definition of Good and Evil: Good is what you
            like. Evil is what you don't like.

            Too much freedom is dangerous to those who
            cannot cope with the responsibilities that
            accompany independence.

            When people ask me, "What gives you the right
            to suggest standards for others?", my answer
            is, "If I don't, someone else,
            perhaps less qualified, will." History has
            proven that qualification is based on
            acceptance. The end justifies the means.

            Hair on a man's chest is thought to denote
            strength. The gorilla is the most powerful
            bipeds and has hair on every place on his
            body except for his chest

            Those who come begging for help want to
            hear that I can help them. They don't really
            want to be helped, though. If they could stop
            searching for help they would die of
            satisfaction. I don't want to implement such
            dire consequences. If I even begin to help
            them, they will soon hate me and try to make
            trouble. Therefore, I tell them fall before
            their ships come in. In that way, I do truly help
            them. I save them for future failures.
